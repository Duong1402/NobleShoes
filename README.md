Hi, I'm Duong, leader of this project.
We have done this project with team of 5 people through many difficulties.
And today, I will show you what you need to run this project in local host

1. Application
- You need to install Jdk 17.3, IntellJ, Visual studio code, SQL server, Spring Boot 3, Vuejs, Java environment
- Most of them can be searched tutorial installation in youtube or internet

2. Set up
- You need to open my FE files in VScode, BE files in IntellJ, and database files in SQL servers
- After first step, you reload file `pom.xml` at BE file and run `npm install` in FE file to install libraly file, run file database to create db or you can change `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none` to `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none` at file application.properties
- Change most of set up like username, password of database, cloudinary,... to compatible with your set up at your PC

3. Run PJ
- After all of those step, now you need to run BE and FE, hope that works immediately
- Check that in console log, nothing go wrong and 2 files run successful
- Now you can search "localhost:5173/login-employee" to go to employee page or "localhost:5173" to go customer page

Note: 
- I recommend you to use ChatGPT or Gemini to help you run this PC if an error occurs during the process
